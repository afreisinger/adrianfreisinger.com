Hello! My name is Adrián Freisinger and I enjoy solving real-world problems and bring
them down to code. My interest in coding started during my freshman year at college.
<!-- when I decided to build an [automatic door lock system](https://www.newline.co/courses/build-a-spotify-connected-app) using Arduino. It gave me a sense of how powerful programming can be! -->

At ARCA, I am the part of [SuperHeros](https://www.arca.gob.ar/) team. We are developing engineering solutions focused on improving user experience and streamlining problem resolution through well-designed digital systems
<!-- I also recently [published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjedCSq7-J0) in which I
explaing how I have designed and implemented a log ingester system which allows bulk
insertion of log data through HTTP and provides the ability to query on the ingested
data in real-time. Make sure to check that out if you are a fan of large scale system
design. You will surely find something great. -->

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
